# Slides Extended

**Create Awesome Presentations in Obsidian**

[Slides Extended](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended) is an open source plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to create [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) based presentations in Obsidian. With this tool anyone who is able to create a note in Obsidian can also create a beautiful presentation.

> [!NOTE]
> We follow the philosophy of `convention over configuration`.
> In most cases it is sufficient to simply write a Slide in **Obsidian Markdown syntax**.
