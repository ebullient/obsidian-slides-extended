## Slide 1:  Test Formula

Different math rendering with and without show grid
- with grid: rendering like inline formula
- without grid: rendering like block  
    (position of $t \to \infty$ changes)

$$\lim_{t \to \infty} (w(t) - y(t)) = 0$$

## Slide 2: Test Equation with Templates

- Test equation-template
- Formula is rendered as inline-formula independent of grid on/off settings like (like
