## Installation

Slides Extended is an official community plugin. Here's how you can install it:

1. Open Obsidian and go to `Settings`.
2. Click on `Community Plugins`.
3. Make sure "Safe Mode" is turned off.
4. Click on `Browse`.
5. Search for `Slides Extended`.
6. Click `Install` on the `Slides Extended` plugin.
7. After installation, make sure to enable the plugin by toggling it on in the `Installed Plugins` section.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended/releases).
   You need the files: `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `style.css` and `slides-extended.zip`.
2. In Obsidian, open your vault's root folder in your file explorer.
3. Navigate to the `.obsidian/plugins` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
4. Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file into a new folder within the `plugins` directory.
5. Copy the file `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `style.css` into the folder `slides-extended`.
5. Restart Obsidian or reload your vault.
6. Go to `Settings` > `Community Plugins` and make sure "Safe Mode" is turned off.
7. Click on `Browse` under `Community Plugins`, find `Obsidian Slides Extended`, and enable it.

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin folder is named `slides-extended` and contains the `.zip`-contents, like `css`, `dist`, `plugin`, `template`,
> but also the additional files `mainfest.json`, `main.js`, and `style.css`.


### Installation Using BRAT

If you prefer to use BRAT for plugin management:

1. Ensure you have BRAT installed. If not, follow the [BRAT installation guide](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#readme).
2. In Obsidian, open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for "BRAT: Add a Beta Plugin".
3. Enter `ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended` as the GitHub repository.
4. BRAT will handle the installation. Once complete, restart or reload your vault for changes to take effect.

## Acknowledgements

MatthÃ¤us worked on this plugin for a long time, and [announced that he was discontinuing](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/discontinued-advanced-slides-create-markdown-based-reveal-js-presentations-in-obsidian/28243) the plugin on the forum.

This plugin was a huge undertaking. I'm just picking up where MatthÃ¤us left off.
