## Installation

Since Obsidian Slides Extended is not yet an official community plugin, it requires manual installation or installation using BRAT (Bundled Resources Action Tools). Here's how you can do it:

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended/releases).
2. In Obsidian, open your vault's root folder in your file explorer.
3. Navigate to the `.obsidian/plugins` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
4. Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file into a new folder within the `plugins` directory. The folder name should be `slides-extended`.
5. Restart Obsidian or reload your vault.
6. Go to `Settings` > `Community Plugins` and make sure "Safe Mode" is turned off.
7. Click on `Browse` under `Community Plugins`, find `Obsidian Slides Extended`, and enable it.

### Installation Using BRAT

If you prefer to use BRAT for plugin management:

1. Ensure you have BRAT installed. If not, follow the [BRAT installation guide](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#readme).
2. In Obsidian, open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for "BRAT: Add a Beta Plugin".
3. Enter `ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended` as the GitHub repository.
4. BRAT will handle the installation. Once complete, restart or reload your vault for changes to take effect.

Remember, as this plugin forks an existing project, there may be changes or improvements over time. Keep an eye on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended) for updates and information on future official community plugin status.

## Acknowledgements

Matthäus worked on this plugin for a long time, and [announced that he was discontinuing](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/discontinued-advanced-slides-create-markdown-based-reveal-js-presentations-in-obsidian/28243) the plugin on the forum.

This plugin was a huge undertaking. I'm just picking up where Matthäus left off.
